<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="index.html"></a>Our Mission:</h4>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MovingForward Agency is offering the travel opportunities to be suitable with people for all ages and strengths of backgrounds. Creating website should provide for selling the packages via online and give specific information and give other services such as promotions from its own website. If agency has online booking system, all kinds of customers can book packages easily and can increase getting number of customers. When customers who are from the long distance with the agency or having no time to go to agency want to book the desired package which is uploaded on the website but there is no online booking system, the problem of customers' inconvenient came out and customers will search another agency which can have online booking system so agency will face less customers and agency's image will be effected. Online booking system is created because all customers can book easily the packages via online. The information in own website are specific and reliable for customers and services for customers should stay up-to-date of the most current and timely about promotions. When festivals for example; Thadingyut, New Year, Thingyan, Christmas or other company's anniversary come, MovingForward Agency offers giving the fair promotion price for sale. Another step of MovingForward Agency is to extend its business throughout the large city in Myanmar by opening branch in Taunggyi. </p>
